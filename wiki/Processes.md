This page describes important processes within the **SnowballR** project.
The goal is to provide a clear overview of how interactions between users and the system are structured,
from account creation to project collaboration and internal processes.

Each process is documented either as a diagram, a step-by-step description, or a combination of both.
Where useful, additional clarifications are provided to highlight the involved components and their responsibilities.
This helps developers and contributors understand where functionality is implemented and how the different parts of the
system interact.
