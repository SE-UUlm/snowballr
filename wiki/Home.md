**SnowballR** is a Snowballing-SLR Web Application. Made to improve the process of creating and conducting SLRs.

#### SLR

A _Systematic Literature Review_ (SLR) is a structured and methodical procedure for identifying, evaluating and
synthesizing relevant research results or papers on a clearly defined research question. The aim is to obtain a
comprehensive overview of the current state of research, minimize bias and gain reliable findings.

#### Snowballing

_Snowballing_ is a complementary technique in which relevant literature is found by analyzing references
(backward snowballing) and citations (forward snowballing) of previously identified papers. This method enables a more
systematic identification of relevant literature that may have been overlooked in the initial search, and thus improves
the completeness of the literature search.
