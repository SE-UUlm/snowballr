## Getting Started with SnowballR

This guide will help you set up your development environment and get your first code changes running.

>**Note**: It is recommended to read the [Contributing page](https://github.com/SE-UUlm/snowballr/wiki/Contributing)
> first to get a general understanding of how we develop this project. Nevertheless, by following the steps on this page
> the SnowballR code can be run.

## Prerequisites

First, make sure you have installed the following:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Java 21](https://adoptium.net/) (for backend)
- [Node.js 22](https://nodejs.org/en) (for frontend)
- IDE of your choice (e.g. [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/),
  [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

## Next Steps

If all prerequisites are installed, SnowballR can be started. Since SnowballR consists of an independent frontend and
backend, both need to be started. To do so, read the instructions in the
[frontend repository](https://github.com/SE-UUlm/snowballr-frontend) and the
[backend repository](https://github.com/SE-UUlm/snowballr-backend).
